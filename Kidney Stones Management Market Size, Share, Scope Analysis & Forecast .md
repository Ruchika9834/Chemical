Among these, non-invasive procedures such as Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL) are prevalent due to their efficacy in fragmenting stones without the need for surgical intervention. ESWL is particularly favored for its minimal invasiveness, which reduces recovery time and the risk of complications. This procedure utilizes shock waves generated outside the body to break stones into smaller pieces that can be more easily passed through the urinary tract. Furthermore, advancements in technology have enhanced the precision and effectiveness of ESWL, solidifying its role as a cornerstone in the management of kidney stones. As the global prevalence of kidney stones continues to rise, the demand for such non-invasive treatments is expected to grow, driving the market forward.</p><p>In contrast, invasive procedures such as Ureteroscopy and Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) cater to cases where non-invasive methods are insufficient. Ureteroscopy involves the use of a thin tube inserted through the urethra to directly visualize and remove stones, making it a viable option for stones located in the ureter or bladder. PCNL is employed for larger stones, typically those that are too big to be treated effectively with ESWL or ureteroscopy. This procedure involves a small incision in the back to access and remove stones directly from the kidney. Both methods are integral to comprehensive kidney stone management, addressing a broader spectrum of cases and contributing to the market's growth. The increasing complexity of cases and the need for specialized treatment solutions are anticipated to drive demand for these invasive procedures, shaping the market landscape.</p></p><p id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Reseach Report @ <a target="">https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=820664&utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=280</a></strong></p><h3 id="" class="">Who is the largest manufacturers of&nbsp;Kidney Stones Management Market worldwide?</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Allengers Medical Systems</Li><Li> Boston Scientific Corporation</Li><Li> C.R.
